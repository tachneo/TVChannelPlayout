file_output.py: Saves the output video to a file.
resolution_settings.py: Configures video resolution and format settings.
resource_management/: Monitors and manages system resources to ensure stable performance.

cpu_monitor.py: Monitors CPU usage.
memory_monitor.py: Monitors memory usage.
alert_system.py: Provides alerts if system resources exceed certain thresholds.
customization/: Handles user interface customization and theme management.

theme_customization.py: Manages theme settings (light/dark mode).
settings_panel.py: Provides a settings panel for adjusting application configurations.
user_profiles.py: Manages user profiles and saves user-specific settings.
logging_reporting/: Manages logging and reporting for the application.

activity_logs.py: Logs user activities within the application.
error_reporting.py: Handles error reporting.
playout_history.py: Logs the history of played videos.
security/: Handles authentication and access control.

authentication.py: Manages user authentication (login, logout, etc.).
access_control.py: Manages user roles and permissions.
backup_restore/: Handles backup and restoration of playlists and settings.

playlist_backup.py: Manages backing up playlists.
restore_functionality.py: Restores playlists from backups.
integration/: Manages integration with external tools and APIs.

external_tools.py: Integrates with external command-line tools like ffmpeg.
api_support.py: Provides API support for the application.
utilities/: Provides utility functions for enhancing video content.

clock_overlay.py: Adds a clock overlay to videos.
subtitle_management.py: Manages subtitles, including adding and synchronizing them.
aspect_ratio_control.py: Adjusts the aspect ratio of videos.
assets/: Stores media files such as logos, watermarks, tickers, and videos.

Key Considerations & Potential Improvements
File Not Found & Path Issues:

Ensure all external tools like ffmpeg have correct paths configured, especially in a cross-platform context.
Consider adding checks for file existence before attempting to load or execute them (e.g., playlists, external tools).
Error Handling:

Implement comprehensive error handling across all modules to catch and log errors that might occur during file I/O, subprocess execution, and other operations.
Configuration Management:

Use configuration files (e.g., config.json) to store paths and other settings, making it easier to change these without modifying the code.
Consider adding a settings management class to handle the loading and saving of configurations.
Modularity & Reusability:

Ensure that each module is self-contained and can be reused in different contexts. For example, the PlaylistManager could be used independently of the GUI.
Security:

Review security mechanisms, especially around user authentication and access control, to ensure they are robust and prevent unauthorized access.
Consider adding encryption for sensitive data, such as user credentials.
Logging:

Enhance logging to include more detailed information, such as timestamps, severity levels, and context for each log entry.
Consider using a logging framework like Python's built-in logging module for more flexibility.
Testing:

Implement unit tests for critical functions across the modules to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Consider creating test cases for each module, especially those handling file I/O and subprocess calls.
User Interface:

Make sure the GUI is intuitive and easy to navigate, especially for users who may not be tech-savvy.
Consider adding more visual feedback in the UI for ongoing processes, such as loading spinners or progress bars.
Performance:

Monitor the performance of the application, especially when handling large video files or multiple simultaneous processes.
Optimize code where possible, such as using efficient data structures or minimizing I/O operations.
Documentation:

Ensure each module is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each class and function.
Consider creating a README.md file that explains how to set up and run the application, including any dependencies that need to be installed.
Final Checklist
